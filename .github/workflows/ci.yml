name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build
      run: swift build
    - name: Test
      run: swift test
```

Now I will update the `next.md` file to mark the task as completed and proceed to the ARCHIVE step.
